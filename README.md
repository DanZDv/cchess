# c_chess

# Project Overview:
# This is a personal project with many learning objectives, the goal is to create a simple Waylan GUI Chess application using C.
# I intend to document my progress through GIT commits as I learn.

# Learning Objectives:
# Familiarize myself with NVim, TMUX, and Linux development in general
# Familiarize myself with git usage from the terminal
# Learn Low level features of C, IE: pointers, memory management, etc...
# Learn how to use the GTK+ library to create Desktop applications within a linux environment

# Project Goal:
# The program will be a simple chess game which runs on the desktop. The user will have the ability to play against a CPU, or observe two CPU's playing against each other.
# The program should have the ability to save games in a .txt file and replay them. There should be a UI for the user to navigate between turns for game analysis
# Multiplayer / networking is NOT in the initial scope of this project.
# Further objectives may be added at a later date.

# Project Setup / Dependencies
# Will be updated as the program develops
